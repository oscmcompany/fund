> Agentic tooling context

## Notes

- Rust and Python are the primary project languages
- [Flox](https://flox.dev/) manages project environment and packages
- [Mask](https://github.com/jacobdeichert/mask) is used for command management
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) manages cloud infrastructure via the Python SDK
- Python code follows [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) workspace conventions
- Rust code follows Cargo workspace conventions
- AWS is the target cloud provider
- Models are primarily built using [tinygrad](https://docs.tinygrad.org/)
- Python servers primarily use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- Use `mask development` commands for respective language final code checks
- Add in-line code comments only where necessary for clarity
- Use full word variables in code whenever possible
- Follow Rust and Python recommended casing conventions
- Strictly use Python version 3.12.10
- Scan and remove unused dependencies from `pyproject.toml` files
- Move duplicate dependencies into root workspace `pyproject.toml`
- Include type hints on all Python function parameters and return types
- Rust servers primarily use [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/)
- Use Polars for [Python](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/index.html) and [Rust](https://docs.rs/polars/latest/polars/) dataframes
- Use `typing` module `cast` function for `tinygrad` method outputs when necessary with union types
- When adding `ValueError` exceptions, create a separate variable called `message` to hold the error string before raising
- When logging after an exception, use `logger.exception()` to capture stack trace with the `structlog` package
- Structured log messages should be short sentences with sentence case (e.g., "Starting data sync" not "STARTING DATA SYNC")
- When debugging or fixing bugs, check Sentry errors, ECS logs, and Alpaca account status to understand what happened
- After fixing a bug, create a git commit with a detailed summary of the root cause and fix in the commit message
- `tools/` folder contains development utilities and scripts
- `applications/` folder contains deployable services and training workflows
- `libraries/` folder contains shared code resources
- `infrastructure/` folder contains Pulumi infrastructure as code
- See `README.md` "Principles" section for developer philosophy
